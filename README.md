# [A3] Basic3D

### Overview
The project is an elementary 3D modeling application titled “Basic3D.” The application allows a user to create and export meshes in a manner similar to 3ds Max or Blender. The user must be able to place vertices, edges, and faces into 3D space, view the custom shape on the screen at various camera angles, modify the mesh in a number of ways, and export the finished model in the OBJ format. The software will be a simplified version of existing robust products, and is designed to be friendly to beginning artists and less cluttered in general. Benefits to this type of approach include a broader appeal to a causal audience who may otherwise feel intimidated by the complexity of other programs. However, the implicit drawback to a streamlined piece of software is a limitation on capabilities and more simplistic visual feedback to the user. Some of these limitations will be able to be resolved through a simple plugin system allowing users to extend the application to suit their needs.
